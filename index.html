        <h3>My Story:</h3>
        <p>Hey! I am originally from Los Banos. I moved to Fresno in '03 to attend Fresno State, where I studied art and design. I graudated in 2010 and worked as a designer for a couple of local tech startups in Fresno and for the last 6 years I've been working as a designer at Revcom Advertising.
          <br>I joined Geekwise because I have an interest in UI/UX design and front end development.
          <br>Other than that I like to travel (just came back from Hong Kong), hiking, video games and craft beers.
        </p>
